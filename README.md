# Crossword
The crossword game isn't fully built yet, as I still have to work on the project. However, I thought of shipping it as a milestone, so I'm making progress. For the AI component, I used it to highlight hints and hover over blocks accordingly. I knew how to implement this feature with a single div, but I encountered challenges when trying to apply it to multiple blocks.
